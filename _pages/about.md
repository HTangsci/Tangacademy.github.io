## Hao Tang ()

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Plant Biodiversity and Ecology at the **University of Kaiserslautern-Landau (RPTU)**, Department of Natural and Environmental Sciences, working with Prof. Dr. Peter Müller, Prof. Dr. Gabriele E. Schaumann, and Prof. Dr. Susanne Liebner.  

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in Rhizosphere Biogeochemistry at the **University of Münster (ILÖK)** and an Assistant Research Fellow at **Sichuan Normal University**. I obtained my Ph.D. in Ecology from the **University of Hamburg** (Institute of Plant Science and Microbiology), under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Kai Jensen.

## Research Interests
My research focuses on the **mechanisms of carbon stability in wetlands**, including coastal wetlands, peatlands, and alpine meadows.  
I use tools such as:  
- **Full-spectrum warming experiments**  
- **¹³C continuous stable isotope labeling**  
- **Root Economics Spectrum (RES) analysis**  
- **Microbial metabolic pathway studies**  

to investigate how litter decomposition, rhizosphere effects, and microbial communities shape soil carbon stability under climate change.
